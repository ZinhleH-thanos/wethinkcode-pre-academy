# 🌱 My Coding Journey at WeThinkCode_
**Name:** Zinhle
**Start Date:** July 11, 2025
[![GitLab](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitLab-Mirror-orange?logo=gitlab)](https://gitlab.com/ZinhleH-thanos/wethinkcode-pre-academy)

## 📅 Week 0: Python Basics (Completed July 15)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use input() and print() to interact with users

- String methods like .lower() and .replace()

- Basic math operations in Python

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `indoor.py` — makes text lowercase

- `playback.py` — adds "..." between words to slow down speech

- `faces.py` — changes :) and :( into real emojis

- `einstein.py` — calculates E = mc²

- `tip.py` — calculates how much tip to leave at a restaurant

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
***July 12:*** I accidentally created hello.py on my Desktop. I moved it using:
mv ~/Desktop/hello.py ~/wethinkcode-pre-academy/

***July 13:*** I got a push rejection when using Git. I fixed it with:
git pull origin main && git push origin main

***July 14:*** I created file names with spaces. I fixed this using:
mv "Deep Thought.py" deep_thought.py

😄 How I Felt
I was proud to finish my first week! Git was a bit confusing, but I started getting the hang of it. Excited to learn conditionals next.

## 📅 Week 1: Conditional Logic (Completed July 22)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- Writing decision-making code using if, elif, and else

- Cleaning up user input with .strip() and .lower()

- Converting time formats (like 7:30 → 7.5)

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `deep.py` — checks if the answer is “42”

- `bank.py` — gives different responses based on greetings

- `extensions.py` — detects file types from their extensions

- `interpreter.py` — does basic math from a string like "3 + 2"

- `meal.py` — tells you if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time

### 💡 Something New I Tried
In meal.py, I converted time like this:
hours = float(hours) + (float(minutes) / 60)

😄 How I Felt
Week 1 felt more challenging than Week 0, but it was fun! I liked building small apps that actually respond differently based on user input.

## 📅 Week 2: Loops & Practice Projects (Completed July 24)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- How while and for loops work in Python

- Using loops to control the flow of programs

- Validating input and repeating prompts until the user gives a correct response

- Writing cleaner logic using functions

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `camel.py` — converts camelCase to snake_case

- `coke.py` — simulates a vending machine that accepts coins

- `twttr.py` — removes all vowels from a sentence or word

- `plates.py` — checks if a vanity plate meets formatting rules

- `nutrition.py` — returns calorie information for a fruit

😄 How I Felt
This week had a lot more logic and testing involved, but I loved the challenge. Every project felt like a little puzzle I needed to solve. I’m getting better at reading tasks and understanding what is required, but I always struggle with what the code is supposed to look like and the syntax. I just hope I will get better with time!

### 🛠 Tools I'm Using
- Codespace from CS50 for most of my coding

- GitHub and GitLab to save and back up my work

- VS Code when I need to do edits on my own

## 📅 Week 3: Functions & Error Handling (Completed August 5)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating programs that handle fractions and percentages
- Working with dictionaries to build menu systems
- Counting and sorting items for grocery lists
- Converting between different date formats
- Proper error handling with try/except blocks

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `fuel.py` — calculates fuel percentage from fractions (E for empty, F for full)
- `taqueria.py` — keeps track of taco orders and running totals
- `grocery.py` — counts grocery items and sorts them alphabetically
- `outdated.py` — converts dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
***July 31:*** Got stuck on fuel.py when testing with 5/4 input. Fixed by adding validation for fractions where numerator > denominator.

***July 31:*** taqueria.py wasn't recognizing "Baja Taco" correctly. Solved by using .title() to standardize the input format.

***July 31:*** outdated.py crashed with September 8, 1636 format. Fixed by carefully splitting the string and handling commas.

😄 How I Felt
This week really tested my problem-solving skills! The date conversion problem was especially tricky, but I felt so accomplished when I finally got it working. I'm starting to see how all the Python concepts connect together.
