### 🛠 Tools I'm Using
- CS50 Codespace  
- GitHub and GitLab

- Had issues with case sensitivity in input  
- Learned how to carefully handle unusual date formats

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week really tested my problem-solving skills! The date conversion task was especially tricky, but I felt proud when I solved it. I'm starting to see how everything I've learned fits together.

- Formatting names in lists  
- Making simple games and quizzes  
- Checking real-time data online  

### 💻 Projects I Worked On

- adieu.py — formats farewell messages  
- game.py — number guessing game  
- professor.py — math quiz  
- bitcoin.py — checks Bitcoin prices  

### ⚠️ Problems I Solved

**August 11:**  
- Fixed issues with online data not loading  
- Corrected math quiz scoring  

**August 12:**  
- Reinstalled tools that weren’t working  
- Fixed emoji and font display problems  

### 🔧 New Things I Tried
1. Installing external tools  
2. Using open-source libraries  
3. Accessing live data from the web  
4. Writing programs with multiple features  

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week was tough but exciting! The tools I used made Python feel more powerful. The Bitcoin checker made me feel like a real programmer. I still need to practice using libraries and modules better.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 5: Testing My Code </strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to write **simple tests** for my code (using something called `pytest`)
- Why testing is important (it catches mistakes before they become problems!)
- How to check if my code works perfectly (using `check50`)

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
1. **Testing my twttr** (`twttr.py`)  
   - Made a program that removes vowels from words (like Twitter → Twttr)
   - Learned to test it with ALL CAPS words and mixed words

2. **Back to the Bank** (`bank.py`)  
   - Made a bank greeting program that gives $0 for "hello", $20 for "hi", $100 otherwise
   - Had to make sure it works even if people type "HeLLo" weirdly

3. **Vanity Plates** (`plates.py`)  
   - Made a license plate checker (so cool!)
   - Hardest part: Making sure numbers only come at the end (like "CS50" is okay but "CS50P" isn't)

4. **Refueling** (`fuel.py`)  
   - Made a fuel gauge that shows E (empty) or F (full)
   - Tricky part: Handling fractions like 1/100 and 99/100 correctly

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
**August 16:**  
- My license plate checker kept saying "AAA22A" was valid (it's not!)
- Fixed it by checking if letters come after numbers

**August 17:**  
- My fuel gauge showed 1% when it should say "E"
- Added a special check for numbers 1% or lower

**August 18:**  
- Tests failed when people typed "hElLo" with mixed caps
- Used `.lower()` to make all greetings lowercase first

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week was tough but really interesting! I never thought about testing my code before. At first, I didn't understand why we needed tests, but now I see how they help catch sneaky bugs. I'm proud that I made all my programs pass every test!

The license plate problem was the hardest - I had to rewrite my code 3 times! But when all tests finally passed, it felt amazing. I'm starting to feel like a real programmer!

### 🌟 Favorite Moment
When my fuel gauge correctly showed "F" for 99% full - it felt like magic!

<details> <summary>📅 <strong>Week 6: File I/O & Libraries </strong></summary>
### 🧠 What I Learned
   -How to read from and write to files in Python
   -Working with CSV files and data processing
   -Using external libraries like tabulate and Pillow
   -Handling command-line arguments with sys.argv
   -Validating file types and handling errors

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
1. **Lines of Code Counter** (`lines.py`)
   -Counts actual code lines in Python files, ignoring comments and blank lines
   -Learned to validate file extensions and handle command-line arguments

2. **Pizza Menu Formatter** (`pizza.py`)
   -Uses the tabulate library to create beautiful ASCII tables from CSV data
   -Learned to install and use external Python packages

3. **Data Cleaner** (`scourgify.py`)
   -Processes CSV files to split combined names into first/last columns
   -Practiced working with CSV data and transforming it

4. **Image Processor** (`shirt.py`)
   -Uses the Pillow library to overlay CS50 shirts on images
   -Learned basic image processing and manipulation

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
   -File Validation: Making sure programs check for correct file extensions (.py, .csv, .jpg/.png)
   -Library Installation: Had to learn how to install external packages using pip
   -Command-Line Arguments: Properly handling different numbers of arguments and error messages
   -Image Processing: Understanding how to resize, crop, and overlay images correctly

### 🔧 New Tools & Libraries
   -sys for command-line arguments and exiting programs
   -csv for working with CSV files
   -tabulate for creating formatted tables
   -Pillow (PIL) for image processing
   -os.path for file path operations

### 😄 How I Felt
This week was amazing! I felt like a "real" programmer working with files, data, and images. The pizza formatter was my favorite - seeing plain CSV data turn into beautiful tables felt like magic. The image processing was challenging but so rewarding when I got it working.

-I'm starting to see how all the pieces fit together - command-line arguments, file handling, data processing, and using external libraries. This week made me feel like I could build useful tools that solve real problems!

2. Internet problems can happen — plan ahead  
3. Start by testing with small, simple values  
4. Read the task instructions carefully
5. File handling and external libraries make Python incredibly powerful
6. Proper error handling makes programs much more robust and user-friendly
