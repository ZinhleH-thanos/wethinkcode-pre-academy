# 🌱 My Coding Journey at WeThinkCode_
**Name:** Zinhle
**Start Date:** July 11, 2025
[![GitLab](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitLab-Mirror-orange?logo=gitlab)](https://gitlab.com/ZinhleH-thanos/wethinkcode-pre-academy)

## 📅 Week 0: Python Basics (Completed July 15)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use input() and print() to interact with users

- String methods like .lower() and .replace()

- Basic math operations in Python

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `indoor.py` — makes text lowercase

- `playback.py` — adds "..." between words to slow down speech

- `faces.py` — changes :) and :( into real emojis

- `einstein.py` — calculates E = mc²

- `tip.py` — calculates how much tip to leave at a restaurant

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
***July 12:*** I accidentally created hello.py on my Desktop. I moved it using:
mv ~/Desktop/hello.py ~/wethinkcode-pre-academy/

***July 13:*** I got a push rejection when using Git. I fixed it with:
git pull origin main && git push origin main

***July 14:*** I created file names with spaces. I fixed this using:
mv "Deep Thought.py" deep_thought.py

😄 How I Felt
I was proud to finish my first week! Git was a bit confusing, but I started getting the hang of it. Excited to learn conditionals next.

## 📅 Week 1: Conditional Logic (Completed July 22)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- Writing decision-making code using if, elif, and else

- Cleaning up user input with .strip() and .lower()

- Converting time formats (like 7:30 → 7.5)

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `deep.py` — checks if the answer is “42”

- `bank.py` — gives different responses based on greetings

- `extensions.py` — detects file types from their extensions

- `interpreter.py` — does basic math from a string like "3 + 2"

- `meal.py` — tells you if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time

### 💡 Something New I Tried
In meal.py, I converted time like this:
hours = float(hours) + (float(minutes) / 60)

😄 How I Felt
Week 1 felt more challenging than Week 0, but it was fun! I liked building small apps that actually respond differently based on user input.

## 📅 Week 2: Loops & Practice Projects (Completed July 24)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- How while and for loops work in Python

- Using loops to control the flow of programs

- Validating input and repeating prompts until the user gives a correct response

- Writing cleaner logic using functions

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `camel.py` — converts camelCase to snake_case

- `coke.py` — simulates a vending machine that accepts coins

- `twttr.py` — removes all vowels from a sentence or word

- `plates.py` — checks if a vanity plate meets formatting rules

- `nutrition.py` — returns calorie information for a fruit

😄 How I Felt
This week had a lot more logic and testing involved, but I loved the challenge. Every project felt like a little puzzle I needed to solve. I’m getting better at reading tasks and understanding what is required, but I always struggle with what the code is supposed to look like and the syntax. I just hope I will get better with time!

### 🛠 Tools I'm Using
- Codespace from CS50 for most of my coding

- GitHub and GitLab to save and back up my work

- VS Code when I need to do edits on my own

## 📅 Week 3: Functions & Error Handling (Completed August 5)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating programs that handle fractions and percentages
- Working with dictionaries to build menu systems
- Counting and sorting items for grocery lists
- Converting between different date formats
- Proper error handling with try/except blocks

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `fuel.py` — calculates fuel percentage from fractions (E for empty, F for full)
- `taqueria.py` — keeps track of taco orders and running totals
- `grocery.py` — counts grocery items and sorts them alphabetically
- `outdated.py` — converts dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
***July 31:*** Got stuck on fuel.py when testing with 5/4 input. Fixed by adding validation for fractions where numerator > denominator.

***July 31:*** taqueria.py wasn't recognizing "Baja Taco" correctly. Solved by using .title() to standardize the input format.

***July 31:*** outdated.py crashed with September 8, 1636 format. Fixed by carefully splitting the string and handling commas.

😄 How I Felt
This week really tested my problem-solving skills! The date conversion problem was especially tricky, but I felt so accomplished when I finally got it working. I'm starting to see how all the Python concepts connect together.

## 📅 Week 4: New Python Tools (Completed August 11-12)
### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to add emojis to my programs
- Making big text art with different styles
- Better ways to format lists of names
- Creating simple number guessing games
- Building a math practice program
- Checking real Bitcoin prices online

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- `emojize.py` - Changes codes like ":cat:" into 🐱
- `figlet.py` - Makes cool text banners
- `adieu.py` - Says goodbye to names nicely ("A, B, and C")
- `game.py` - Number guessing game with hints
- `professor.py` - Math quiz that gives scores
- `bitcoin.py` - Shows current Bitcoin prices

### ⚠️ Problems I Solved
***August 11:***  
- Bitcoin checker wasn't working - Fixed by adding error checks
- Math quiz score was wrong - Fixed the counting

***August 12:***  
- Text art fonts didn't load - Reinstalled the font tool
- Emojis didn't show - Had to install the emoji package first

### 😄 How I Felt
This week was tough but exciting! I learned how to use new tools that make Python do even cooler things. The math quiz was tricky to get right, but it felt amazing when it finally worked perfectly. Checking real Bitcoin prices made me feel like a real programmer and it was super exciting. I still need more practice with libraries and modules.

### 🔧 New Things I Tried
1. Installing new tools with `pip install`
2. Using other people's code (libraries)
3. Getting data from the internet (APIs)
4. Making programs with multiple parts

✅ **My Progress**  
Week 0: Done ✅  
Week 1: Done ✅  
Week 2: Done ✅  
Week 3: Done ✅  
Week 4: Done ✅  
Week 5: Coming Soon...

💡 **What I Learned**  
1. Don't build everything from scratch - use existing tools
2. Internet connections can fail - always have a backup plan
3. Test with simple numbers first
4. Read the instructions carefully
