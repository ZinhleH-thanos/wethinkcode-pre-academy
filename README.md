🌱 My Coding Journey at WeThinkCode_

📅 Week 0: Python Basics (Completed July 15)
🧠 What I Learned
How to use input() and print() to interact with users.

String methods like .lower() and .replace().

Basic math operations in Python.

💻 Projects I Worked On
indoor.py — makes text lowercase.

playback.py — adds "..." between words to slow down speech.

faces.py — changes :) and :( into real emojis.

einstein.py — calculates E = mc².

tip.py — calculates how much tip to leave at a restaurant.

⚠️ Challenges I Faced
July 12: I accidentally created hello.py on my Desktop. I moved it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
mv ~/Desktop/hello.py ~/wethinkcode-pre-academy/
July 13: I got a push rejection when using Git. I fixed it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main && git push origin main
July 14: I created file names with spaces. I fixed this using:

bash
Copy
Edit
mv "Deep Thought.py" deep_thought.py
😄 How I Felt
I was proud to finish my first week! Git was a bit confusing, but I started getting the hang of it. Excited to learn conditionals next.

📅 Week 1: Conditional Logic (Completed July 22)
🧠 What I Learned
Writing decision-making code using if, elif, and else.

Cleaning up user input with .strip() and .lower().

Converting time formats (like 7:30 → 7.5).

💻 Projects I Worked On
deep.py — checks if the answer is “42”.

bank.py — gives different responses based on greetings.

extensions.py — detects file types from their extensions.

interpreter.py — does basic math from a string like "3 + 2".

meal.py — tells you if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time.

💡 Something New I Tried
In meal.py, I converted time like this:

python
Copy
Edit
hours = float(hours) + (float(minutes) / 60)
😄 How I Felt
Week 1 felt more challenging than Week 0, but it was fun! I liked building small apps that actually respond differently based on user input.

📅 Week 2: Loops & Practice Projects (Completed July 24)
🧠 What I Learned
How while and for loops work in Python.

Using loops to control the flow of programs.

Validating input and repeating prompts until the user gives a correct response.

Writing cleaner logic using functions.

💻 Projects I Worked On
camel.py — converts camelCase to snake_case.

coke.py — simulates a vending machine that accepts coins.

twttr.py — removes all vowels from a sentence or word.

plates.py — checks if a vanity plate meets formatting rules.

nutrition.py — returns calorie information for a fruit.

😄 How I Felt
This week had a lot more logic and testing involved, but I loved the challenge. Every project felt like a little puzzle I needed to solve. I’m getting better at reading tasks and understanding what is required, but I always struggle with what the code is supposed to look like and the syntax. I just hope I will get better with time!

🛠 Tools I'm Using
Codespace from CS50 for most of my coding.

GitHub and GitLab to save and back up my work.

VS Code when I need to do edits on my own.
