## Week 1: Getting Started  
### Day 1 (11 July 2025)  
- **Goal**: Set up Python, Git, and create first script.  
- **Progress**:  
  - Installed Python and verified with `python --version`.  
  - Created `hello.py` and ran it successfully.  
  - Pushed code to GitHub using Git commands.  
- **Struggles**:  
  - Initially confused about which terminal to use (learned VS Code's terminal is best!).  
- **Tomorrow's Plan**: Start CS50P Week 0 (`indoor.py`).  

## Week 0: CS50P Submissions  
- [x] [indoor.py](Week0/indoor.py) - Converts text to lowercase.  
- [x] [playback.py](Week0/playback.py) - Replaces spaces with `...`.  
- [ ] faces.py (Next task)
