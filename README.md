<summary>📅 <strong>Week 0: Python Basics (Completed July 15)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to interact with users using input and print
- Using string methods like lowercase and replace
- Performing basic math operations

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- indoor.py — makes text lowercase  
- playback.py — slows down speech by adding pauses  
- faces.py — replaces :) and :( with emojis  
- einstein.py — calculates energy from mass  
- tip.py — calculates tips at restaurants  

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
**July 12:**  
Created a file in the wrong folder and had to move it

**July 13:**  
Faced Git push errors and resolved them

**July 14:**  
Created file names with spaces and learned to rename them properly

### 😄 How I Felt  
I was proud to finish my first week! Git was a bit confusing, but I started getting the hang of it. Excited to learn conditionals next.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 1: Conditional Logic (Completed July 22)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Writing programs that make decisions using conditions
- Cleaning and formatting user input
- Converting time formats

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- deep.py — checks for a specific response  
- bank.py — responds to greetings  
- extensions.py — identifies file types  
- interpreter.py — performs basic calculations  
- meal.py — identifies mealtimes  

### 💡 Something New I Tried
Learned to convert time more precisely using hour and minute values

### 😄 How I Felt  
Week 1 felt more challenging than Week 0, but it was fun! I liked building small apps that respond differently based on user input.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 2: Loops & Practice Projects (Completed July 24)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How loops work in Python  
- Using repetition to improve user interaction  
- Validating input and retrying when necessary  
- Creating functions to organize code better  

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- camel.py — converts camelCase to snake_case  
- coke.py — simulates a coin-based vending machine  
- twttr.py — removes vowels from words  
- plates.py — validates custom license plates  
- nutrition.py — gives fruit calorie info  

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week had a lot more logic and testing involved, but I loved the challenge. I’m getting better at understanding what a task wants, but I still struggle a bit with how to write the code itself. I hope that improves with time.

### 🛠 Tools I'm Using
- CS50 Codespace  
- GitHub and GitLab  
- VS Code

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 3: Functions & Error Handling (Completed August 5)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating functions for reusable logic  
- Working with dictionaries and menus  
- Counting and sorting data  
- Converting between date formats  
- Handling errors with try/except  

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- fuel.py — converts fractions to percentages  
- taqueria.py — tracks orders and totals  
- grocery.py — counts and sorts grocery items

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
**July 31:**  
- Struggled with validating fractions  
- Had issues with case sensitivity in input  
- Learned how to carefully handle unusual date formats

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week really tested my problem-solving skills! The date conversion task was especially tricky, but I felt proud when I solved it. I'm starting to see how everything I've learned fits together.

## 💡 Key Lessons I've Learned So Far

1. Don’t build everything from scratch — use tools and libraries  
2. Internet problems can happen — plan ahead  
3. Start by testing with small, simple values  
4. Read the task instructions carefully
