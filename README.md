<summary>📅 <strong>Week 0: Python Basics (Completed July 15)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to interact with users using input and print
- Using string methods like lowercase and replace
- Performing basic math operations

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- indoor.py — makes text lowercase

- tip.py — calculates tips at restaurants  

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
**July 12:**  
Created a file in the wrong folder and had to move it

**July 13:**  
Faced Git push errors and resolved them

**July 14:**  
Created file names with spaces and learned to rename them properly

### 😄 How I Felt  
I was proud to finish my first week! Git was a bit confusing, but I started getting the hang of it. Excited to learn conditionals next.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 1: Conditional Logic (Completed July 22)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Writing programs that make decisions using conditions
- Cleaning and formatting user input
- Converting time formats

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- deep.py — checks for a specific response  
- bank.py — responds to greetings  
- extensions.py — identifies file types  
- interpreter.py — performs basic calculations  
- meal.py — identifies mealtimes  

### 💡 Something New I Tried
Learned to convert time more precisely using hour and minute values

### 😄 How I Felt  
Week 1 felt more challenging than Week 0, but it was fun! I liked building small apps that respond differently based on user input.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 2: Loops & Practice Projects (Completed July 24)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How loops work in Python  
- Using repetition to improve user interaction  
- Validating input and retrying when necessary  
- Creating functions to organize code better  

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- camel.py — converts camelCase to snake_case  
- coke.py — simulates a coin-based vending machine  
- twttr.py — removes vowels from words  
- plates.py — validates custom license plates  
- nutrition.py — gives fruit calorie info  

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week had a lot more logic and testing involved, but I loved the challenge. I’m getting better at understanding what a task wants, but I still struggle a bit with how to write the code itself. I hope that improves with time.

### 🛠 Tools I'm Using
- CS50 Codespace  
- GitHub and GitLab  
- VS Code

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 3: Functions & Error Handling (Completed August 5)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating functions for reusable logic  
- Working with dictionaries and menus  
- Counting and sorting data  
- Converting between date formats  
- Handling errors with try/except  

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- fuel.py — converts fractions to percentages  
- taqueria.py — tracks orders and totals  
- grocery.py — counts and sorts grocery items  
- outdated.py — changes date formats  

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
**July 31:**  
- Struggled with validating fractions  
- Had issues with case sensitivity in input  
- Learned how to carefully handle unusual date formats

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week really tested my problem-solving skills! The date conversion task was especially tricky, but I felt proud when I solved it. I'm starting to see how everything I've learned fits together.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 4: New Python Tools (Completed August 11–12)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Adding emojis to programs  
- Creating text art  
- Formatting names in lists  
- Making simple games and quizzes  
- Checking real-time data online  

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
- emojize.py — adds emojis using codes  
- figlet.py — creates large styled text  
- adieu.py — formats farewell messages  
- game.py — number guessing game  
- professor.py — math quiz  
- bitcoin.py — checks Bitcoin prices  

### ⚠️ Problems I Solved

**August 11:**  
- Fixed issues with online data not loading  
- Corrected math quiz scoring  

**August 12:**  
- Reinstalled tools that weren’t working  
- Fixed emoji and font display problems  

### 🔧 New Things I Tried
1. Installing external tools  
2. Using open-source libraries  
3. Accessing live data from the web  
4. Writing programs with multiple features  

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week was tough but exciting! The tools I used made Python feel more powerful. The Bitcoin checker made me feel like a real programmer. I still need to practice using libraries and modules better.

<summary>📅 <strong>Week 5: Testing My Code (Completed August 19)</strong></summary>

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to write **simple tests** for my code (using something called `pytest`)
- Why testing is important (it catches mistakes before they become problems!)
- How to check if my code works perfectly (using `check50`)

### 💻 Projects I Worked On
1. **Testing my twttr** (`twttr.py`)  
   - Made a program that removes vowels from words (like Twitter → Twttr)
   - Learned to test it with ALL CAPS words and mixed words

2. **Back to the Bank** (`bank.py`)  
   - Made a bank greeting program that gives $0 for "hello", $20 for "hi", $100 otherwise
   - Had to make sure it works even if people type "HeLLo" weirdly

3. **Vanity Plates** (`plates.py`)  
   - Made a license plate checker (so cool!)
   - Hardest part: Making sure numbers only come at the end (like "CS50" is okay but "CS50P" isn't)

4. **Refueling** (`fuel.py`)  
   - Made a fuel gauge that shows E (empty) or F (full)
   - Tricky part: Handling fractions like 1/100 and 99/100 correctly

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
**August 16:**  
- My license plate checker kept saying "AAA22A" was valid (it's not!)
- Fixed it by checking if letters come after numbers

**August 17:**  
- My fuel gauge showed 1% when it should say "E"
- Added a special check for numbers 1% or lower

**August 18:**  
- Tests failed when people typed "hElLo" with mixed caps
- Used `.lower()` to make all greetings lowercase first

### 😄 How I Felt  
This week was tough but really interesting! I never thought about testing my code before. At first, I didn't understand why we needed tests, but now I see how they help catch sneaky bugs. I'm proud that I made all my programs pass every test!

The license plate problem was the hardest - I had to rewrite my code 3 times! But when all tests finally passed, it felt amazing. I'm starting to feel like a real programmer!

### 🌟 Favorite Moment
When my fuel gauge correctly showed "F" for 99% full - it felt like magic!

## 💡 Key Lessons I've Learned So Far

1. Don’t build everything from scratch — use tools and libraries  
2. Internet problems can happen — plan ahead  
3. Start by testing with small, simple values  
4. Read the task instructions carefully
