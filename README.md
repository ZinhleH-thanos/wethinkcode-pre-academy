# 🌱 My Coding Journey at WeThinkCode_
**Name**: Zinhle  
**Start Date**: July 11, 2025  

## 📅 Week 0: Python Basics (Completed July 15, 2025)
### What I Learned:
- How to use `input()` and `print()`
- String methods like `.lower()` and `.replace()`
- Basic math operations

### Files Completed:
1. `indoor.py` - Makes text quiet (lowercase)
2. `playback.py` - Slows down speech with "..."
3. `faces.py` - Turns :) into 🙂 and :( into 🙁
4. `einstein.py` - Calculates E=mc²
5. `tip.py` - Calculates restaurant tips

### Big Challenges:
**July 12, 2025** - File Confusion  
- Created `hello.py` on my Desktop by mistake  
- Fixed by moving it:  
  ```bash
  mv ~/Desktop/hello.py ~/wethinkcode-pre-academy/
July 13, 2025 - Git Problems

Got "rejected" error when pushing to GitHub

Solved with:

bash
git pull origin main
git push origin main
July 14, 2025 - Naming Issues

Made files with spaces like Deep Thought.py

Had to rename them:

bash
mv "Deep Thought.py" deep_thought.py
