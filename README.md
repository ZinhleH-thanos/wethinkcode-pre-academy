## Week 1: Getting Started  
### Day 1 (11 July 2025)  
- **Goal**: Set up Python, Git, and create first script.  
- **Progress**:  
  - Installed Python and verified with `python --version`.  
  - Created `hello.py` and ran it successfully.  
  - Pushed code to GitHub using Git commands.  
- **Struggles**:  
  - Initially confused about which terminal to use (learned VS Code's terminal is best!).  
- **Tomorrow's Plan**: Start CS50P Week 0 (`indoor.py`).  

# 🌱 My Coding Journey - Week 0

## Completed Tasks
1. **indoor.py**  
   - Made a program that converts SHOUTING to quiet text.  
   - *Struggle:* Forgot to save before running the first time!  
   - *Win:* Learned `input()` and `lower()`.

2. **playback.py**  
   - Changed normal speech to...slow...motion.  
   - *Struggle:* Tried `" ".join(...)` first (too complicated).  
   - *Win:* Discovered `replace()` works perfectly!

3. **faces.py**  
   - Turned boring emoticons :) into happy emojis 🙂.  
   - *Struggle:* The emojis showed as boxes until I restarted VS Code.  
   - *Win:* Made my first function with `convert()`!

4. **einstein.py**  
   - Calculated energy from mass (E=mc²).  
   - *Struggle:* Forgot Python uses `**` for exponents, not `^`.  
   - *Win:* Finally understand why c is squared!

5. **tip.py**  
   - Built a tip calculator for restaurants.  
   - *Struggle:* Spent 30 minutes debugging why `$50.00` became `5000.0`.  
   - *Win:* Learned to remove `$` and `%` properly.

## How I Feel
- 😅 *Overwhelmed* by new concepts but proud I finished everything!
- 🤯 *Mind-blown* that simple code can do useful things.
- 📝 *Note to self:* Test with weird inputs (like `$0.00` or `100%`) next time.

## What's Next?
- Week 1: Conditionals (if/else statements)
