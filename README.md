## Week 1: Getting Started  
### Day 1 (11 July 2025)  
- **Goal**: Set up Python, Git, and create first script.  
- **Progress**:  
  - Installed Python and verified with `python --version`.  
  - Created `hello.py` and ran it successfully.  
  - Pushed code to GitHub using Git commands.  
- **Struggles**:  
  - Initially confused about which terminal to use (learned VS Code's terminal is best!).  
- **Tomorrow's Plan**: Start CS50P Week 0 (`indoor.py`).
